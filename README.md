Fixed Pixels

Extension that fixes pixels, all thanks to this post by Nullsleep http://nullsleep.tumblr.com/post/16417178705/how-to-disable-image-smoothing-in-modern-web-browsers by Nullsleep. 

Simple style insertion with javascript, can probably be done way better, so let's fix it, and add firefox/safari support, and a toggle button would be cool.

Yeps!
Peace!
